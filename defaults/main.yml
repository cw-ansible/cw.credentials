## credentials_groups: list of group definitions
#
# Each list element is a dictionary as defined in the 'group' module (See
# ansible-doc group for further detail about how to define a group).
#
# As long as the 'user' module creates a group for each user you probably
# don't want to create a group for a new user unless you do have special
# needs.
#
##
# credentials_groups:
#   - name: webdev
#     uid: 2000
#


## credentials_users: list of user definitions
#
# Each list element is a dictionary as defined in the 'user' module (See
# ansible-doc user for further detail about how to define a user).
#
# In addition some other keys can be defined:
#
# - 'hosts': a list of (or a single) host definitions to be matched against
#   'ansible_hostname' If 'hosts' is defined AND a match occurs, the user is
#   created. The user is deleted otherwise. The match is done using
#   fnmatch. Use '*' to match all hosts.
#
# - 'ssh_keys': A list of dictionary which item follows the Ansible
#   'authorized_key' module.
#
# - 'sudo': A list of lines that should be installed on the sudoers
#   files. The line is added as it ans validated using the '/usr/sbin/visudo
#   -cf %s' command. On modern platforms where '/etc/sudoers.d' is
#   supported, the lines are inserted on the '/etc/sudoers.d/USER' file
#   instead of '/etc/sudoers'
#
##
# credentials_users:
#   - name: vagrant
#     uid: 1000
#     comment: 'Vagrant'
#     hosts: '*'
#     ssh_keys:
#       - key: INSERT_VAGRANT_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
#     sudo:
#       - line: 'vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL'
